Our first product, CrossCures XC, is an end-to-end tool based on a novel AI algorithm that objectively evaluates the severity of neck dystonia using TWSTRS2. This is espeically useful in home monitoring of dystonia patients and to accurately track and record neck dystonia for the purpose of precision medicine. This can aso be used when patients are transferring between different clinicians and to track treatment response - especially regarding botox treatments. White paper for the algorithm used here - Coming Soon
