Our first product, CrossCures Assess-X, is an end-to-end tool based on a novel AI algorithm that objectively evaluates the severity of neck dystonia using TWSTRS-2. This is similar to how an MRI or CT scan turns anatomical information into computerized data, whereas our algorithm turns locomotory information into computerized data. This is especially useful in home monitoring of dystonia patients and to accurately track and record neck dystonia for the purpose of precision medicine. This can also be used when patients are transferred between different clinicians and to track treatment response - especially with regards to botox treatments. White paper for the algorithm used can be found here - <b><i>Coming Soon</i><b>.
