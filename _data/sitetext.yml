      - title: "Our Humble Beginnings"
        year: "2022"
        desc: "We initially met during a hackathon and realized our shared passion for addressing the issue of subjectivity in neurological examinations. Our approach involved utilizing open-source pose determination algorithms, but the initial results yielded poor accuracy. This marked the beginning of our journey, during which we dedicated two months to enhancing the existing freely available pose estimation algorithms. Our efforts paid off, as our project ultimately earned us first place in the Hack For XDP 2022 hackathon."

      - title: "Rebuilding Our Concept"
        year: "2022 - 2023"
        desc: "After several iterations, our project's accuracy remained persistently low. As a result, we pivoted away from the established concepts underpinning current pose-detection algorithms and redid the entire project from scratch. We focused on using our expertise to build a bespoke AI algorithm tailored specifically to our needs. To fine-tune our algorithm, we connected with leading neurologists from institutes such as Mass General, UPMC and Mayo Clinic. We finally came up with the first iteration of our custom algorithm, which we named after our winning Hackathon project: XDP-GAIT. This algorithm used a radically different approach that had never previously been explored."

      - title: "Testing at Mass General"
        year: "June 2023"
        desc: "As co-founders, we were invited to the Movement Disorder Laboratory at Mass General to evaluate and reiterate our algorithm using data from real patients. After two months of continuous failures, novel innovations and rapid prototyping, we successfully achieved significant improvements in our algorithm."

      - title: "CrossCures Is Born"
        year: "August 2023"
        desc: "The model performed exceptionally well in these preliminary tests, achieving an accuracy rate of up to 95%. It demonstrated remarkable ease in handling even the most severely affected patients. With this, the 7th iteration of XDP-GAIT is now renamed to CrossCures as we officially begin our journey."
